Crystal glints with wine,
Petals whisper in the breeze,
Colors softly blend.

Emerald clusters,
Steam rises in morning light,
Greens dance on the plate.

Silent man watches,
Sunlit blooms kiss whispering
shade of ancient bark.

Tall necks stretch skyward,
Rippling grass and water blend,
Wings dance, shadows glide.

Windswept dreams take flight,
Colors dance on ocean's breath,
Silhouettes in sun.

Whiskers twitch in glass
Soft eyes meet their mirrored gaze
Shadow stirs alone

Gentle woolly forms
Rest beside the emerald
Whispers in the pines

Layers swirl with cream
He leans, savoring sweet time
Joy drifts like soft air

Sunlight on white cloth
Waves kiss the weathered board
A dog dreams of surf

[group_id: 215]
Stone reaches skyward,
Time whispers from the tower,
Spire crowns silence’ peace.
