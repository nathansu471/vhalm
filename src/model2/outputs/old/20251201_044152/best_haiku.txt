Laughter fills the room
Bright crumbs sprinkle the table
Chairs await their tales

[group_id: 4]
Porcelain and glass,
Petals whisper in sunlight,
Colors breathe and bloom.

[group_id: 341]
Wheels spin on the rise,
Voices blend with city hum,
Shadows dance in light.

[group_id: 732]
Man whispers to green,
A vase cradles fallen light,
Bark embraces time.

[group_id: 151]
Warm sun spills through glass,
Laughter dances on the breeze,
Crumbs fall like small dreams.
