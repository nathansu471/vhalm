Colors dance on wind
Laughter echoes with the waves
Sky and sea embrace

[group_id: 1317]
Whispers in the pines
black and white forms on wood rest
wings pause, wood breathes deep

Sunset glows on grass
A bat slices through warm air
Hope hangs, poised in time

[group_id: 1988]
Sunset's warm embrace,
Laughter dances on fresh crust,
Greens weave dreams of taste.

White ball in the air,
Racket arcs through summer light,
Joy leaps with each swing.

Waves kiss golden sand
A blue shirt dances with joy
Frisbee soaring high

[group_id: 1952]
Rackets slice through air,
Sunlight dances on the court,
Laughter meets the breeze.

[group_id: 2042]
Echoes in the throng,
A clock ticks beneath bright lights,
Footsteps dance and pause.

Rusty wheels whisper
Crimson and ivory rest
Steel serpent glides past

[group_id: 907]
Salt spray in the air,
He dances on azure backs,
Ocean's pulse beneath.
